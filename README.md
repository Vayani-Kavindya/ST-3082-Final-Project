Dynamic Ride Price Prediction - Exploratory and Advanced analysis

The global ride-sharing market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by increasing demand for convenient, affordable, and technology-driven transportation solutions. A key factor in this expansion has been the widespread adoption of mobile app-based ride-sharing services, which allow users to seamlessly book rides from nearby drivers at competitive rates. These services often prove to be a more cost-effective alternative to traditional taxi services, further fueling their popularity(Source:https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/ridesharing-market-103336). Dynamic pricing has emerged as a standard practice in the ride-sharing industry, first introduced by Duke University and widely adopted by companies like Uber and Lyft since 2015. This pricing model divides metropolitan areas into smaller hubs, where fares are adjusted in real-time based on demand fluctuations. By doing so, it ensures optimal pricing for both passengers and drivers, balancing affordability and profitability.

In light of these developments, a ride-sharing company aims to enhance its pricing strategy by incorporating a  dynamic pricing approach that adjusts fares based on real-time market conditions. Currently, the company determines fares solely based on ride duration, which limits its ability to respond to changing demand and other  influencing factors. To address this, the company plans to leverage data-driven techniques to analyze historical data and develop a predictive model that adaptively sets prices in response to dynamic market conditions.
